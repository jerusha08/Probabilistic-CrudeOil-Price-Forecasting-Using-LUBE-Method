# A Study on Probabilistic Forecasting of Crude Oil Price using LUBE Method
This project involves predicting the intervals in which future prices of crude oil may fall. It draws interval forecasts for monthly, weekly, and daily crude oil prices.
# Overview
This project focuses on the probabilistic forecasting of crude oil prices using the LUBE (Lower Upper Bound Estimation) method combined with optimized deep learning models. By predicting the intervals within which future prices may fall, this study aims to provide valuable insights for market analysis and decision-making. The project is part of a research study titled "A Study on Probabilistic Forecasting of Crude Oil Prices employing Optimized Deep Learning Models and LUBE method,‚Äù currently under review at Asia-Pacific Financial Markets, Springer (ManuscriptID: FEJM-S-24-00317). The research was conducted under the supervision of Senior IEEE Professor S. Panigrahi.
# Methodology
We employed the LUBE method for probabilistic forecasting, utilizing optimized deep learning models to predict the intervals within which future crude oil prices may fall. The forecasts were drawn for different timeframes, including monthly, weekly, and daily prices.
# Results
The project successfully predicted the intervals for future crude oil prices, providing valuable insights for market analysis and decision-making.
# Usage
To use this project, follow the steps below:
1. Prepare your dataset and ensure it is in the correct format.
2. Run the forecasting scripts to generate interval forecasts.
3. Analyze the results and interpret the interval predictions for different timeframes.
